Bugs to fix:
When try to move a piece to a position it cant move it changes the players turn.
Fix rest of castle
King doesnt get checked when promoting
updateAvailableMoves gets called every time even if no move is made

when promoting a pawn, the enemy gets + 1 pawn capture on card, and removes the piece that was chosen. My points go up by the piece value


right white night to f3, black pawn to e5, heatmap doesnt include knight attack on pawn
